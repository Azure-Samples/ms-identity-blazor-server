## Overview

This sample demonstrates an ASP.NET Core Blazor Server application that authenticates users with the Microsoft Identity Platform.

## Scenario

1. The client ASP.NET Core Blazor Server application uses the Microsoft Authentication Library [MSAL.NET](http://aka.ms/msal-net) and [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://aka.ms/microsoft-identity-web) libraries to sign-in a user in their tenant and obtain an [ID Tokens](https://aka.ms/id-tokens) from **Azure AD**.
1. The **ID Token** proves that the user has successfully authenticated against **Azure AD**.

![Overview](./ReadmeFiles/topology.png)

## Prerequisites

- Either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

## Setup

### In the downloaded folder

From your shell or command line:

```console
cd ms-identity-blazor-server\WebApp-OIDC\MyOrg
```

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the webApp app (WebApp-blazor-server)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `WebApp-blazor-server`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `https://localhost:44318/`.
     > Note that there are more than one redirect URIs used in this sample. You'll need to add them from the **Authentication** tab later after the app has been created successfully.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
   - If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Web** option.
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, enter the following redirect URIs.
      - `https://localhost:44318/signin-oidc`
   - In the **Implicit grant** section, check the **ID tokens** option.
   - In the **Logout URL** section, set it to `https://localhost:44318/signout-oidc`.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.

#### Configure the webApp app (WebApp-blazor-server) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `appsettings.json` file.
1. Find the key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `WebApp-blazor-server` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.

## Running the sample

You can run the sample by using either Visual Studio or command line interface as shown below:

### Run the sample using Visual Studio

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.

### Run the sample using a command line interface such as VS Code integrated terminal

#### Step 1. Install .NET Core dependencies

```console
cd blazorserver-singleOrg
dotnet restore
```

#### Step 2. Trust development certificates

```console
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Learn more about [HTTPS in .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl).

#### Step 3. Run the applications

In the console window execute the below command:

```console
dotnet run
```

## Explore the sample

1. Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:44318`.
1. Select the **Sign in** button on the top right corner. When the user signs-in for the first time , a consent screen is presented with required permissions, select **Accept**. 

    You will see claims from the signed-in user's token.

## How was the code created

1. Run the following command to download the templates for Microsoft.Identity.Web

   ```console
   dotnet new -i Microsoft.Identity.Web.ProjectTemplates::1.1.0
   ```

1. Create the application by running the following command:

   ```console
   dotnet new blazorserver2 --auth SingleOrg
   ```

1. Add `UserClaims.razor` component and `UserClaimsBase.cs` class.

## About the code

1. In `Startup.cs`, add below lines of code in **ConfigureServices** method:

    ```csharp
    services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration);
    ```

    This enables your application to use the Microsoft identity platform endpoint to sign-in users.

1. **Index.razor** is the landing page when application starts. Index.razor contains child component called `UserClaims`. If user is authenticated successfully, `UserClaims` displays a few claims present in the ID Token issued by Azure AD.

1. In the `UserClaimsBase.cs` class, **GetClaimsPrincipalData** method retrieves signed-in user's claims using the **GetAuthenticationStateAsync()** method of the **AuthenticationStateProvider** class.

     ```csharp
    public class UserClaimsBase : ComponentBase
    {
        [Inject]
        private AuthenticationStateProvider AuthenticationStateProvider { get; set; }
        protected string _authMessage;
        protected IEnumerable<Claim> _claims = Enumerable.Empty<Claim>();
        private string[] printClaims = { "name", "preferred_username", "tid", "oid" };
        protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
        {
            await GetClaimsPrincipalData();
        }
        private async Task GetClaimsPrincipalData()
        {
            var authState = await AuthenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
            var user = authState.User;
            if (user.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                _authMessage = $"{user.Identity.Name} is authenticated.";
                _claims = user.Claims.Where(x => printClaims.Contains(x.Type));
            }
            else
            {
                _authMessage = "The user is NOT authenticated.";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Next chapter of the tutorial: the Web app calls Microsoft Graph

In the next chapter, we will enhance this Web app to call downstream Web API (Microsoft Graph).
